# GDS

hardened using openlane to the gds file included.

# spice

* hardweario_webinar_poc_inv2.spice is the one used for LVS by openlane
* hardweario_webinar_poc_inv2_extracted.spice is the one extracted from the GDS by running the following commands in magic:
    *    extract
    *    ext2spice lvs
    *    ext2spice

# simulation

* run make ok to use the 1st spice, which works.
* run make broken to use the 2nd spice, which gives a non changing 1v output

## ok

![ok](./ok.png)

## broken

![broken](./broken.png)

# to reproduce

change the .include lines in the simulation.spice files to match your PDK path
